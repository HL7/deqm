<p><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/measurereport.html">MeasureReport</a> is used as an organizer for both data exchange for measure and for measure reporting.  Three profiles on the MeasureReport resource are defined in this guide to delineate these different uses.  The <strong>DEQM Summary MeasureReport Profile</strong> defined here is used when a measure is reported to an aggregator for a group of patients. It contains all of the data that is relevant to generate the report including the measure outcome and is similar to a QRDA Category 3 report.  Unlike the <a href="StructureDefinition-indv-measurereport-deqm.html">DEQM Individual MeasureReport Profile</a>, the report is typically transacted as a single MeasureReport report.</p>
